## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* I really like how they mentioned how people with a growth mindset are less likely to avoid a challenge. I believe every student in here has some
type of growth mindset. Coming from all walks of life and committing time, money and effort into a brand new field. I have been to college, served for 8 years across two branches, started investing in real estate and now I'm attending Turing to help me succeed in my future.  
* I agree how sometimes where you are born can lead you to have a fixed mindset. A person whose family are farmers is more likely to become a farmer    himself since that is all their are surrounded by. This is why having a growth mindset in all parts of life can help you live your life to the fullest
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* A very easy answer is learning how to use a MacBook. All my life I've used windows but I understand that it is needed to succeed at Turing and maybe even after so I will learn it as best I can. I do not have a growth mindset about working out. I go with my friend everyday and let him run the show. There is nothing that interests me or catches my attention to make me dive deeper into that realm
3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
* Conditional statements are used to perform a certain outcome if a specific condition is method
* examples are : ``==`` ``>`` ``!=``
4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
* you'd use it there are more than one possible outcome
5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
* `if conditional
     puts" gibberish"
  else conditional
     puts" other gibberish"
  end`
6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
by using `elsif`
7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

`if water == hot
   puts "careful super hot water"
elsif water == dry
   puts "there's no water here"
else water == cold
   puts "this water is ice cold"
end`

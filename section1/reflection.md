## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
Somewhere in between for me. Sometimes I ask questions before I give myself a chance to find an answer because of
laziness but sometimes my stubbornness keeps me stuck on something that someone could help me with in minutes.
2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
p "Hello World!"
3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
#
4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
an integer is a whole number while a float lets you keep track of the decimal point if there is one
5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = "zebra"
6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
p animal
7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
it's a way of glueing strings together and used more often than the sign +

print
9. Name and describe two common string methods:
single quote you can't use string interpolation

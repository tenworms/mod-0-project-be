## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
* I didn't particularly enjoy it because it feels like to many brakes. I understand that brakes are necessary to create good work but to me I feel like I do better if I dive into something for about 50 minutes and then maybe take a break. If I'm in a good workflow I like to keep going until the job is done. This behavior come from being a mechanic in the military, where the day is not over until the job is done most of the times. It was common to work through lunches and physical training to get the job done.
2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I feel like I have gotten better at estimating certain tasks since this is the third section of this. I know I need to spend less time learning new terms and how they are used than doing the exercises and having to troubleshoot why something worked before and now its not working.
3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
* It's a way to store data like a list but instead of only using numbers to get the data, you can use almost anything. An array is for an ordered array of items while a hash is for matching some items to other items.
4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
`pet_store = { dog_toys: 23, cat_toys: 17, rat_treats: 590, horse_swings=3}``

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`p states[1]`
6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`puts "#{pet_store.keys}"` `puts"#{pet_store.values}`
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
* It can be used as a map or associate things you want to store to keys you need to get them. It's better because it lets you use anything, not just numbers as your index.
8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
How to make everything fall in order like when we did `sample.each`. it would look better and more organized instead of just having a long sentence.
